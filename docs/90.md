## Current and Voltage Rating

AB-90 switches are rated for use with XT-90 connectors and 10AWG wire.  We have tested stead-state currents up to 300 amps and the switch remains working until after the wire has de-soldered from the XT-90.  We have tested voltages up to 6s with the 100 ohm 1/4 watt anti-spark resistor, higher voltages may require a different value for this resitor (likely a 100 ohm, 1/2 watt resistor)
